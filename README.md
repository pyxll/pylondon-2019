This repo contains the slides and demo materials from the talk
"Integrating Excel and Python" given at the London Python meetup 25/04/2019.

To try out the code, add the pyxll.cfg file in the demos folder to your own pyxll.cfg file
as an external config by adding the path to the external_config option in the PYXLL section.

The workbooks used are in the demos folder.

Python 3.7 x64 (Miniconda) was used for the demos.
